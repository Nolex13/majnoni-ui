# Majnoni ui

Web application used for take away food ordering for the Birreria Majnoni.

Based on React Js, Typescript, React Router Dom and Material UI.

Basic start point for any personal Fast food - pizzeria - restaurant ordering project.

I will also create the backend and the backoffice of the application soon!
